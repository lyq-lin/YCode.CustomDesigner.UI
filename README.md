# Refactoring YCodeFlowUI on Main Branch

🔧 The current task on the `Main` branch involves refactoring `YCodeFlowUI`, primarily transitioning from a Canvas-based design to a pure MVVM-driven control approach. This refactoring effort is not intended to assert superiority over the old method but rather aims to learn how to utilize the `Notify` control. I express deep gratitude to individuals with an open-source spirit, similar to the authors of `Notify`.

📁 The previous approach can be found in the source code on the `CanvasDesigner` branch, which has already met the requirements of the MVVM framework. I hope this method can offer valuable assistance to those in need.

📝 For insights into the old approach or development tutorials, please refer to [this informative video tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV177421N76v/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=09ea16918da424f6bed95ad4cd89fcf1).

🙏 Once again, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all outstanding open-source software like `Notify` and their creators!
